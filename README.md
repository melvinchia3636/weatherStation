<p align="center">Display realtime weather data in your little Raspberry Pi.</p>

## The Problem

Before finishing the software of my cloud drive, I'll have to make use of my little Raspverry Pi for some cool stuff.

## The Solution

I've made a weather station that will show weather info and refresh regularly after a certain amount of time.

### What's inside the weather station
- current weather
- date and timezone
- weather forecast of the whole day
- sunrise. sunset, moonrise, and moonset time of the day
- moon phase of the day
- random tech news title from The New York Times
- currency conversion rate from USD to MYR
- Air quality level
- lunar date

## ⌨️ Setup

If you want to run the website on your Raspberry Pi:
1. Install any Linux distro, as long as it's capable of running Python.
2. Buy yourself a 3.5 inches display and install it to your RBPi.
3. Install Python3 and pygame >= 2.0.0.
4. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/melvinchia3636/weatherStation`.
5. Run the script by typing `python3 main.py`.
9. Enjoy!

## 💡 Inspirations 

This project was inspired by [E-Paper Weather Station](https://projects-raspberry.com/raspberry-pi-e-paper-weather-station/). Unfortunately I was too poor and didn't have enough money to buy the e-paper display.
